# Collections-Website

The Collections website was built with flexbox. Very responsive, and shows what is possible with flexbox. The webiste was a codealong with Jen Kramer from Frontend Masters, and building alongside her was a wonderful experience. She gave explanations for why certain things where the way the were in the course and I am grateful for that.
